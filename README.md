# ECCE Jet Properties
This code intends to study properties of jet detection in the [ECCE](https://www.ecce-eic.org/) detector at the EIC.  

## Key Properties
* Jet Energy
    * Scale
        * Using the definition (Reconstructed Jet Energy - Truth Jet Energy) / Truth Jet Energy, what is the scaling of jet energy in reconstruction?  
    * Resolution
        * Similar to the scale, what is the resolution achieved in reconstruction?  This is using the definition RMS ((Reconstructed Jet Energy - Truth Jet Energy) / Truth Jet Energy)
    * Both these metrics make reference to figure 8.43 in the [Yellow Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05419)

* Jet Spatially
    * Scale
    * Resolution
    * These metrics are functionally equivalent to those described for jet energy, only now we are interested in the jets pseudorapidity.  
    * See figure 8.44 in the [Yellow Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05419)

* Efficiency
    * Not yet started
